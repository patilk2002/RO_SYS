Design and optimization of a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system refers to the process of planning, designing, and refining a system to efficiently remove contaminants from water.

The goal of design and optimization is to ensure that the RO system operates at its maximum efficiency and effectively removes contaminants to meet the desired water quality standards.
